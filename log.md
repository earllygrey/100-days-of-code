### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: Saturday, August 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished 6 lessons on Udemy course. Create a calculator and BMI calculator with calculations performed on a local backend server.

**Thoughts** Started the challenge today after finish over an hour's worth of coding. Using this to help keep my momentum and to help me stay motivated. Watching a youtube video that inspires me before I start coding has helped me stay focused during the coding session and looking forward to the progress I continue to make.



### Day 2: Monday, August 30, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons for today and got ahead by 6 lessons. Worked on personal site, mostly playing around with Bootstrap and learning more about the Navbar.

**Thoughts:** Felt really inspired to code late in the night after feeling a little disappointed that I wasn't able to code for most of the day due to some errands. Music definitely helped keep me at that high. I did get some weird gut feelings while I was coding which I'm still processing? Was I scared? And if so why? Despite that, it felt really fun to code today. Tonight was one of the few nights where instead of just strictly learning and creating based on the less, I was coding something that I had created and started up myself and really showed/reminded me of the fun that I creating my own things. It was a comforting feeling. Goal for tomorrow is to learn a little bit more about GitHub so I can start posting the code I've been working on.
