##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: August 29, 2020, Satuday

**Today's Progress**: Finished 6 lessons on Udemy course. Create a calculator and BMI calculator with calculations performed on a local backend server.

**Thoughts** Started the challenge today after finish over an hour's worth of coding. Using this to help keep my momentum and to help me stay motivated. Watching a youtube video that inspires me before I start coding has helped me stay focused during the coding session and looking forward to the progress I continue to make.
